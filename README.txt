Video Game Search

-----DESCRIPTION-----

This website gives the user a form that fetches data on video games stored
in a JSON file. The first two inputs are pulled from this JSON file while 
the third is a free form query to filter based on the second input. On submit
the program returns a HTML document with the requested data where any specifics
requested by the user are bolded such that they are easy to find. If no input
is provided in the third form the program returns all objects match the first
input and bolds the data matching the second form.
